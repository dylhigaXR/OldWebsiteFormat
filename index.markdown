Welcome to my website! Here you'll find small posts on what I'm working on or have worked on in the past.

I'm interested in exploring new technologies and finding potential uses and limitations that come with said tech.

Currently Working With:

- Playing with the OpenAI API and exploring possible uses in Unity and XR
